            Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout (or simply Fall Guys) is a platformer battle royale game developed by Mediatonic and published by Devolver Digital. It released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 on 4 August 2020. The game draws inspiration from game shows like Takeshi's Castle, It's a Knockout and Wipeout, and children's playground games like tag and British bulldog. Fall Guys received positive reviews from critics, who praised its chaotic gameplay and visual appearance.

        <div class="info">Up to 60 players compete in matches with battle royale-style gameplay. Players, represented as jellybean-like figures,move around a three-dimensional playing field, with additional moves such as jumping, grabbing/climbing, or diving to assist gameplay.The aim is to qualify for subsequent rounds by successfully completing each of the randomly selected mini-games. Certain mini-games involve running towards a finish line at the end of the map, while others add elements of teamwork. On every mini-game, obstacles appear around the map for added complexity. Players who are too slow or who fail certain requirements for a mini-game are eliminated. On the final round, the remaining few players compete in a final match with a randomised mini-game designed for a smaller player size.The winner of the match is the last player standing.
