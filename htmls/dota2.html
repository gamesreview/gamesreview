        <div class="info">
            Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. The game is
            a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's
            Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches between
            two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each
            of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique
            abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their
            heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by
            being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.

        <div class="info">Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in which two teams of five
            players compete to collectively destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the
            "Ancient", whilst defending their own. As in Defense of the Ancients, the game is controlled using
            standard real-time strategy controls, and is presented on a single map in a three-dimensional isometric
            perspective. Ten players each control one of the game's 119 playable characters, known as "heroes",
            with each having their own design, strengths, and weaknesses. Heroes are divided into two primary
            roles, known as the core and support.
