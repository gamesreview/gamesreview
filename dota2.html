        <div class="info">Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person shooter set in the
            near-future. Players play as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several
            countries and cultures around the world.In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the
            attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities each
            requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability which requires charging through kills, deaths, or
            spike actions. Each player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and with one or more "signature
            ability" charge. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in game economic system which
            awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any
            actions taken with the spike. The game has an assortment of weapons including sidearms, submachine guns,
            shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. Automatic and semi-automatic weapons such as
            the "Spectre," "Odin," and "Vandal" have recoil patterns which have to be controlled by the player in order
            to be able to shoot accurately.
