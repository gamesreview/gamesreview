        <div class="info">
            Albion Online (AO) is a free medieval fantasy MMORPG developed by Sandbox Interactive, a studio based in Berlin,
            Germany.During the beta stages of development, players were able to purchase "Founder's Packs" to gain access to 
            the closed beta play-tests which were run intermittently by Sandbox Interactive, typically after an interval of a
            few months of development. After the release of the game, these founder's packs were made unavailable for purchase.
             Albion Online removed its free-to-play model for various reasons on December 30, 2015. (Which was then made free again at a later date)

        <div class="info">Albion Online's gameplay centres itself around a classless system,
            in which the equipment a player chooses to wear defines their abilities and the way they can play.
            Players can go out and do activities in Albion's world in order to gain "Fame" 
            (Similar to Experience of other similar MMORPG's such as Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft)
            Through this Fame players can get access to other weapon and armour types, with stronger equipment requiring more Fame to use.
